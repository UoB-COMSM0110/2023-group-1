### Introduction (5% ~250 words)
Our game is a simple 2D platformer, a la Mario etc.  It allows one-player and two-player modes.  It is novel because gravity randomly flips during gameplay from down to up, and vice versa.
[Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel?]

### Requirements (15% ~750 words)
To start the ideation process, we had an in-person brain-storming session.  In this session we came up with a short list of six games that we thought we could make.  With a vote, we trimmed this to two games (a connect-four game where the rows are sometimes destroyed, and a platformer game where gravity inverts).  For both of these games we gathered initial requirements by preparing use-case diagrams (see 'Report Material'/Requirements/useCaseDiagrams/) and user stories (see 'Report Material'/Requirements/userStories).  We then used these reasources to mock-up paper prototypes for both games.  We used these paper prototypes to prepared videos demonstrations of how our game should work (these are viewable at https://youtu.be/0fppWHDHL3Y for the platformer, and https://youtu.be/wAT3H2MjvIE for the connect-four).  

Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?

### Design (15% ~750 words)
System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams.

### Implementation (15% ~750 words)
Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game.

### Evaluation (15% ~750 words)
One qualitative evaluation (your choice)
One quantitative evaluation (of your choice)
Description of how code was tested.

### Process (15% ~750 words)
Our team worked together effectively.  We used Kanban boards to keep a track of the outstanding tasks (We used Atlassian to host these, but have saved PDFs of the board at various stages of development in 'Report Material'/'Kanban Boards').  

We used GitHub to host our work, as was required by the unit.  However, the way we used it developed throughout the project.  We had a games-jam in reading week.  This was a whole-day affair, and was the first significant chunk of time we spent as a team developing the game.  While we were using GitHub to keep a track of our changes, we ran into problems because we had not formalised an agreed-upon workflow.  Therefore, noone was using branches.  Rather we we commiting straight to 'main', or even dropping files directly into the github repo via the gui.  This lead to the situation where people were making great features on their local copy of the repo, but that this was completely different to everyone else's local copy.  Therefore, even though we had managed to make a minimum-viable-product locally, this was not reflected on the GitHub, and took a lot of work to fix (many thanks to Ollie, the TA for helping us untabgle the knots).  Fortunately we were able to recover our work, and this mishap prompted us to  use a standardised Git workflow.  Everyone had a personal branch.  When they were ready with a feature, they had to checkout their local main, pull from origin, checkout their personal branch, merge with main, and only when all conflicts were resolved could they push.  When pushed they had to make a pull request to get their changes into main.  This system worked for us, and we didn't have any other Git mishaps.

Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools did you use. Did you have team roles? Reflection on how you worked together.

### Conclusion (10% ~500 words)
Reflect on project as a whole. Lessons learned. Reflect on challenges. Future work.
Quality of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5%)
Documentation of code (5%)
Individual contribution. Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which may be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent.
