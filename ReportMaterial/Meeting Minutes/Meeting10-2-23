# Minutes

- Taking a vote for which game — unanimous vote for mario style game with antigravity over connect4 style game which we also created a paper prototype for
- Questions around what IDE we can use — concerns that the processing IDE is harder to use than something like IntelliJ: issue to be raised at a later date
- What do we need to create a use-case diagram again:

Functional requirements:

- User needs to be able to interact with the movements of a character through a map
- Map will change as User moves through the environment
- Menu pages with clickable sub-pages:
    - intro screen:
    - leaderboard screen
    - one/two player option
    - start button
    - sound button
- Key directed movements through map:
    - right and left for movement right/left
    - up for jumping
    - (all reversed in zero-g)
- How it should react in particular situations:
    - die if you fall off the map or run into enemy
    - (optional) get a boost if you run into a special object — you cannot die from an enemy for a fixed period of time while you have the boost
    - if you finish you win — takes you to the win page, which shows score and lets you go again or go back to main page or to score board
        - Tasks to get done:
            - upload videos
            - decide on game idea
            - use-case diagram (collect requirements)
    - if you run backwards at the start its just a wall
    - character will be in a fixed screen position and the map moves in the background

Non-functional requirements:

- We need to learn more about processing to specify particular limitations but we can’t foresee any issues with the planned design so far
